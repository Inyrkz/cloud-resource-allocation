# cloud-resource-allocation
This project is an experiment to see how machine learning can be used to predict the amount of cloud resource that should be provided to users.

The Materna cloud trace dataset is used for this experimentation. It can be downloaded [here](http://gwa.ewi.tudelft.nl/datasets/gwa-t-13-materna).

The `materna_cpu_ml.ipynb` notebook shows the prediction of the next CPU usage. 
While the `materna_memory_ml.ipynb` notebook shows the prediction of the next memory usage.
